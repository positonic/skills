Skills are organized into bucket folders under `skills/`:

- `engineering/` — daily code work
- `productivity/` — daily non-code workflow tools
- `misc/` — kept around but rarely used, not promoted
- `personal/` — tied to my own setup, not promoted
- `in-progress/` — drafts not yet ready to ship
- `deprecated/` — no longer used

Every skill in `engineering/` or `productivity/` (the **promoted** buckets) must have a reference in the top-level `README.md` and an entry in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `skills` array (the Claude Code plugin ships exactly the promoted set). Skills in `misc/`, `personal/`, `in-progress/`, and `deprecated/` must not appear in either.

The repo is also its own single-plugin Claude Code marketplace: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lists the one `syntro-skills` plugin. When bumping the release version, keep `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `version` in sync with `package.json`'s — Claude uses the plugin `version` to decide when installed users see an update. Run `claude plugin validate . --strict` after touching either manifest. Why a Claude plugin but not (yet) a Codex one lives in [.agents/adr/0002-ship-as-a-claude-code-plugin.md](./.agents/adr/0002-ship-as-a-claude-code-plugin.md).

Each skill entry in the top-level `README.md` must link the skill name to its `SKILL.md`.

Each bucket folder has a `README.md` that lists every skill in the bucket with a one-line description, with the skill name linked to its `SKILL.md`. The promoted buckets' `README.md`s and the top-level `README.md` group entries into **User-invoked** and **Model-invoked**; non-promoted bucket `README.md`s (`misc/`, `personal/`) use a flat list.

Skills in `engineering/` and `productivity/` also have a human-facing docs page at `docs/<bucket>/<skill-name>.md` (the docs tree mirrors those two bucket folders under `skills/`). The published URL is `https://aihero.dev/skills-<skill-name>` regardless of bucket — the docs path is repo organisation only. When you add, rename, or change the behaviour of a skill in `engineering/` or `productivity/`, create or re-sync its docs page following [.agents/writing-docs.md](./.agents/writing-docs.md). Skills in the non-promoted buckets (`misc/`, `personal/`, `in-progress/`, `deprecated/`) get **no** docs page.

Every `SKILL.md` is either user-invoked (`disable-model-invocation: true` plus `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml`, reachable only by the human) or model-invoked (model- or user-reachable). See [.agents/invocation.md](./.agents/invocation.md).

[`ask-matt`](./skills/engineering/ask-matt/SKILL.md) is the router that maps every user-reachable skill and how they relate. The same trigger that re-syncs a docs page applies to it: whenever you add, rename, remove, or change how a user-reachable skill fits the flows, re-read `ask-matt`'s `SKILL.md` and update it so the map stays accurate — a new skill it never mentions, or a stale one it still routes to, is a router that lies.

To (re)link every skill into the local harness skill directories (`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`), run `scripts/link-skills.sh`. Each entry is a symlink into this repo, so a `git pull` keeps installed skills current; re-run the script after adding, removing, or renaming a skill.

## Fork conventions (positonic/skills)

This fork keeps its own planning-suite names: `/to-prd` (two-zone PRD pages), `/to-robo-prd`, and `/to-tickets` (Exponential, one ticket per scope with ordered actions). Upstream's `to-spec` and its tracker-agnostic `to-tickets` are superseded by these — when syncing upstream, resolve collisions on those paths in this fork's favour and port content improvements instead.

The `docs/engineering/` and `docs/productivity/` pages are vendored from upstream and may reference upstream skill names (`to-spec`, the tracker-agnostic `to-tickets`); don't treat them as this fork's canon — `EXPONENTIAL-TEAM.md` is the team-facing guide. Fork-specific skills don't have docs pages.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in Exponential (workspace: `syntrofi`, product: `agent-skills`) via the `exponential` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Five canonical triage roles, each mapped to an Exponential `ticket.status`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` + `.agents/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
